Hi there! I'm a web developer and devops engineer. I spend my time building scalable web services and APIs. In my free time, I dabble on side projects including [Populrr](https://populrr.com/) and [Mercez](https://millionmilesecrets.com/guides/easily-find-credit-card-currency-conversion-rates-with-mercez-app/).

I also like learning and sharing knowledge on investing whether it's Bogleheads-style with index ETFs or calculating intrinsic value like Buffett and Graham. If you're new to investing, I recommend starting with the [Bogleheads Wiki](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started).
