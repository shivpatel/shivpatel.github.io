I'm a software engineer based in Atlanta that specializes in architecting and building scalable web services and APIs. I've worked as a freelance web designer, startup co-founder (<a href="https://populrr.com/">Populrr</a>, <a href="https://millionmilesecrets.com/guides/easily-find-credit-card-currency-conversion-rates-with-mercez-app/">Mercez</a>), and a full-time employee for Fortune 500 companies.

I'm addicted to JavaScript + functional programming and an advocate for Node, React, Docker, RESTful APIs, queues, and serverless stacks.
