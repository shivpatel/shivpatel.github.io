### Serums

You'll find all the serums listed below available via The Ordinary. **{VC}** designates Vitamin C or a derivative; used for brightening, skin tone, and dark spots. Always apply water soluble serums before oil soluble.

- Niacinamide (B3) 10% + Zinc 1% - For blemishes and congestion.

### Sunscreens (Facial)
Looking for physical sunscreens that use **zinc oxide**, is somewhat water resistant, and fights both UVA/UVB. Products designated with **{S}** contain silicone and may not be suiteable if other, irritating ingredients are included.

- EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 ($20.58/oz)
- Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Dry-Touch Face Sunscreen with SPF 50 ($5.49/oz) **{S}**
- Aveeno Positively Mineral Sensitive Face Sunscreen SPF 50 ($4.99/oz) **{S}**

### Body Lotions
Looking for body lotions with moderate SPF protection and no petrolatum, sulfates, or parabens. Products designated with **{S}** contain silicone and may not be suiteable if other, irritating ingredients are included.

*Research from 01/21/2020 [1] shows chemical sunscreens may be absorbed into the bloodstream at levels that exceed safety thresholds. I have yet to locate a body lotion that meets the above requirements without using chemical sunscreen. My current go-to is one of the below non-SPF lotions paired with a seperate physical sunscreen of choice.*

- Aveeno Sheer Hydration Daily Moisturizing Lotion ($0.39/oz) **{S}**

## Acne Treatment

### Benzoyl Peroxide
- Removes dead skin cells that clogs pores 
- Kills acne-causing bacteria
- Dries excess oil
- Start with 2% strength

### Salicylic Acid
- Removes dead skin cells that clogs pores
- Softens and sloughs top layer of skin 
- Better for white and black heads
- Use 2-3 times a week in a cleanser as chemical exfoliant
