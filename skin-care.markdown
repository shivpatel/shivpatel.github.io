    <h5 style="font-weight:700;">Shopping Tip</h5>
    <p>Aveeno seems to be moving all of their body lotions to petrolatum-inclusive formulas (no good). When buying <i>Aveeno Sheer Hydration Daily Moisturizing Lotion</i>, make sure the product says <strong>Sheer Hydration</strong> and is colored light-blue near the pump.</p>

### Lip Balms
Looking for lip balms with moderate SPF protection and no petrolatum, sulfates, or parabens. Non-SPF options for overnight use only.

## Acne Treatment

### Benzoyl Peroxide
- Removes dead skin cells that clogs pores 
- Kills acne-causing bacteria
- Dries excess oil
- Start with 2% strength

### Salicylic Acid
- Removes dead skin cells that clogs pores
- Softens and sloughs top layer of skin 
- Better for white and black heads
- Use 2-3 times a week in a cleanser as chemical exfoliant
